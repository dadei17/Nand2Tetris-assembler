// The game of life world consists of 2D grid 16x32, the grid is mapped in memory:
// RAM[100] == grid(0, 0)
// RAM[132] == grid(1, 0)
// RAM[611] == grid(16, 31)
//
// RAM[99] contains number of generations to iterate over the Game of life world (aka grid)
//
// Iteration rules:
// For a space that is 'populated':
// * Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
// * Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
// * Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
//
// For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
// * Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
//
// initial values are set by test. The are only two values allowed:
// 1 -- the cell is populated
// 0 -- the cell is empty
